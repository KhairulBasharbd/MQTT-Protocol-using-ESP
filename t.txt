To understand what a remote repository is, itâ€™s important to first understand that 
Git stores and operates on your data in your local file system. In fact, Git is 
referred to as a distributed version control system because the 
source code is stored, or distributed, locally across any number of computers and 
servers. This is different from many of the source control tools that preceded Git.

Those tools were known as centralized version control systems (SVN or Subversion are 
the most well known examples), and they only operated on data hosted on a server by 
uploading changes in real time.

This meant that everybody always had access to the same data, because they were all
 working from the same server, but changes were slow to update and relied on a stable 
internet connection at all times.
